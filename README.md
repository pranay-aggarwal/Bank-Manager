# Bank Employee Management System in Python

This Python code represents a simple Bank Employee Management System, allowing a bank manager to manually input user data into the server. The system includes three main functionalities: adding an account, changing the account balance, and publishing account details. Additionally, the program includes a default bank password for access to sensitive operations.

## Features
1. **Add Account:** The manager can add a new user account by providing the user's name, account balance, and a password. An account number is automatically assigned to the user.

2. **Change Balance:** Users can change their account balance by providing their account number and password. If the password matches, the balance can be updated.

3. **Publish Data:** The manager can publish relevant details of all accounts by entering the default bank password. This feature provides access to the account holders' names, account numbers, and account balances.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the `bank_employee.py` file.

2. Run the Python script using your preferred Python interpreter.

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform different operations:

    a. To add an account, enter the user's name, account balance, and password (6-digit length required). The account number will be assigned automatically. You can continue adding more accounts or exit the process.
    
    b. To change the account balance, enter the account number and the current account password. If the password matches, you can set a new account balance.
    
    c. To publish account details, you need to enter the default bank password. Then, provide the account number for the account you want to retrieve details for.

## Important Note
Please note that this code is a simple implementation for educational purposes and is not suitable for real-world use without significant security enhancements. In a real-world scenario, banking systems require robust security measures, data validation, encryption, and user authentication mechanisms.
